## This is my third commit file
## This file was made by Socasun

* Created in notepad and saved to github/datasciencecoursera on my hard drive.
* opened git and did a series of commands - touch, add, commit, push
* git accepted the commit command, but the commit was not reflected in local github console.
* git failed to accept the push command, message said I was ahead of something and needed to merge branches.
* only way it worked was to do the touch and add commands from git
* then do the commit and synch commands from github console
* went to github via chrome to view results
